Every human don't have the same height no ? So why monsters do ? 

This mod make monsters spawn with a random size !

You can configure the range size for :

- Outside enemies
- Indoor enemies
- Custom enemies

FOR CUSTOM ENEMIES

This is an input, you can for example write -> ForestGiant:1:2;NutCracker:1:2
Make sure to have a separator ';' between monsters, even if you have only one custom enemies !

This normaly should work with modded enemies. For any issues, create an issue on the git page :)

Have fun :)
