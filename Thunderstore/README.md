Every human don't have the same height no ? So why monsters do ? 

This mod make monsters spawn with a random size ! 



You can configure the range size for :

- Outside enemies
- Indoor enemies
- Custom enemies

**Note that:**
- Others mods enemies should be impacted by this mod.
- Only the **player who host the game** config will be taken.

**FOR CUSTOM ENEMIES**

**Recommended:**
You can use [this generator](https://wexop.github.io/RandomEnemiesSizeCustomGeneraror) and copy the result in the input 'CustomEnemiesSize' to custom the range size of each monsters!

**Manualy:**

This is an input, you can for example write -> ForestGiant:1:2;NutCracker:1:2
Make sure to have a separator ';' between monsters, even if you have only one custom enemies !

This normaly should work with modded enemies. For any issues, create an issue on the git page :)

**FUN MODE**
You can activate the fun mode to randomize the size of every axis (x,y,z).
The height range is based on initial configs, but you can config horizontals ranges (x,z)

You can lock the horizontal axis (x and z) to have the same value.

Have fun :)
